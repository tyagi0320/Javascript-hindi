<!--
    //JAVASCRIPT:
    1.It is synchronous[1 piece of code will be executed first, then other code and then other code.]
    2.It is a single threaded language[1 task at a time]

    *The above two behaviours are of a default javascript.

    //Execution context:
    *Execution of one line of code at a time.
    *Each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing.

    //BLOCKING CODE VS NON-BLOCKING CODE:

    //BLOCKING CODE:
    *Blocks the flow of a program.
    *Reads the file synchronously.
    *We need to wait for the notification(notification that required data in a file has been read successfully!) before a task is completed.

    //NON-BLOCKING CODE:
    *Doesnot blocks the execution.
    *Reads the file Asynchronously.
    *We needn't wait for notification.We can continue with our task.As soon as file's data is read we would get notified, we need not wait specially for some notification.

    NOTE: It is nothing like synchronous code is best or asynchronous. We use both of these as per our use cases.

   WORKING OF PROGRAM:

   1.JS ENGINE:
   1.Memory heap
   2.Call stack

   2.WEB-API(inside browser)/NODE(environment):
   1.DOM API[Not in case of node although]
   2.Set timeout
   3.Set interval
   4.fetch()- consists PROMISES and HIGH PRIORITY QUEUE/PROMISE QUEUE [More priority over set timeout and set interval]
   5.Register CALL BACK

   3.TASK QUEUE- It makes the js fast, synchronous and asynchronous.
