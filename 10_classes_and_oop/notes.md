//Js is a prototype based language not object oriented.

//Object oriented feature in Js was introduced in it's ES6 version.

//The classes in Js are just syntactic sugar.This way it provides more familiar syntax to developers coming from class based languages such as Java or C++. Behind the scene Js works as per the prototype mechanism only.

//4 Pillars of OOPS
1.Abstraction - Refers to hiding of details. 
e.g.- fetch()
2.Encapsulation - Refers to wrapping or hiding of data.It allows which data shall be accessed and which data shouldnot.
3.Inheritance - 
4.Polymorphism -
